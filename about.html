<div>A film - also called a movie, motion picture, moving picture, picture, photoplay or (slang) flick  is a work of visual art that simulates experiences and otherwise communicates ideas, stories, perceptions, feelings, beauty, or atmosphere through the use of moving images. These images are generally accompanied by sound and, more rarely, other sensory stimulations.[1] The word "cinema", short for cinematography, is often used to refer to filmmaking and the film industry, and to the art form that is the result of it. 

I remember myself in, sitting in a room, thinking about a solution me and my team could invent to make businesses more successful.

Then, we started thinking about what was the most important factor of every business' success. Without too much thinking...we knew, 100%, that the answer was PEOPLE!

From there, and idea to build a solution for finding and hiring best employees was born! We knew that this was the best way of helping companies build awesome teams and grow.

In 2016, we founded a company with the headquarters in Zagreb, Croatia. </div>
